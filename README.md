# password_generator
This is a small side project I am building, bit by bit.

I plan to create a fully working password ganerator that I can use, features will be added gradually.

The entire script may change as I learn and dedicate more time to developing the project, for now I'm using the libraries: random, string and csv to generate a set of random strings, symbols and numbers, that are then written to a csv file.
